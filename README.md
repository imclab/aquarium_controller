A simple, Arduino based freshwater aquarium controller.

Version: Alpha 4
Author: Chris LÃ¼scher (mail@christophluescher.ch)
Current features:
- Measure: pH, O2, temperature
- Report: pH, O2, temperature, internal time, critical measurement values + critical value changes
- Fertilize: 3 fertilizer pumps
- Control: 5 RC power switches

Disclaimer: this is a personal project. Pumping stuff into your aquarium is DANGEROUS and so is controlling your aquarium hardware via RC switches. Use this project as an inspiration only if you know what you are doing. I provide this information 'as is' without warranty of any kind.
