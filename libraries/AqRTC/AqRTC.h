/*
AqRTC: Arduino RTC library with safe i2c communication, plausibility checking and caching
Rationale: I've seen all kind of strange things happen on my I2C bus. I was able to resolve
most of this, but who guarantees that all my I2C based RTC readings will always be 100% correct?
Regular RTC libraries just accept blindly whatever they read from the RTC. This library does some
advanced checking:
- did the read succeed at all? (yes, this is not checked in the libraries I saw)
- is the time I read within +/-5 seconds of what the Arduino would expect based on millis()?
- did I read two correct times in succession?
If any of these tests fail, this RTC will fall back to guessing the time based on millis(). 
If there are no time reads at all, it will fall back to guessing based on compile time.
If there's an RTC, but it's not running, it will be set to compile time. Compile time
has to be passed to the constructor since libraries are not recompiled on a regular basis.
To improve speed, this library only reads time every 30s.
Currently supports: DS1307, DS3231
